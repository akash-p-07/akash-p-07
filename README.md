### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am [Akash Pawar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akashpawar/).

- Brief intro about me:
  * Education: `BTech` -->  `Sr Associate - DevOps Engineer` --> `MBA` --> 'CSM - Devops Engineer'
  * I love automation, mathematics, problem-solving and learning new skills and implement them to solve different challenges and optimize resources.
  
- Below are the repositories that I used throughout my AWS/DevOps journey while learning different `AWS Services`, `Kubernetes`, `Docker`, `Terraform`, `Ansible`, `Helm`, `Jenkins`, `GitHub`, `Maven`, `ELK`, `Prometheus`, `Grafana`, `Linux`, `Python`, `Bash Scripting`.

  | Repository Name | Description  |
  | ------ | ------ |
  | [Jenkins CI CD Pipeline Project](https://github.com/akash-p-07/Jenkins-CI-CD-Pipeline.git) | This project consist of ultimate CI CD pipleline which includes tools like GitHub, Jenkis, Docker, Maven, Sonarqube, ArgoCD, Kubernetes(Miniqube/GKE). A Docker image is used as an agent for the pipeline which once triggered refers the Grovy script from GitHub and builds a image in DockerHub by completeing different stages, code quality can be tested with Sonarqube and with Helm and ArgoCD we can deploy the image in K8s cluster|
  | [AWS Components & Projects](https://github.com/akash-p-07/AWS.git) | Demos for different AWS Services including IAM, EC2, S3, EBS, ELB, ASG, AWS CLI, SNS, CloudWatch, AWS CodeSatr, EKS, AWS Code Pipeline |
  | [Kubernetes](https://github.com/akash-p-07/Kubernetes.git) | K8s components and steps to set up components like Services, Pods, Schedulers, Load Balancer, Deployment, Persistant Volumes, Node Selectors, Cluster along with yaml files |
  | [Docker](https://github.com/akash-p-07/Docker.git) | Docker, Docker Compose, Volumes, Docker Swarm with examples|
  | [Ansible & Chef ](https://github.com/akash-p-07/Ansible-Chef.git) | This repo consist of installations and different methods with examples which can be used for IaaC (Infrastructure as Configuration) and some examples for managing updates on large scale using Ansible or Chef  |
  | [Bash Scripts](https://github.com/akash-p-07/Bash-Script.git) | Basic components for bash scripting alongwith sample scripts for each type |
  | [Terraform Projects](https://github.com/akash-p-07/Terraform.git) | This repo consist of mutliple terraform projects alongwith scripts in order to provision multiple services via Terraform. I have also added screenshots from so of my live projects |
  | [ELK Stack](https://github.com/akash-p-07/Bash-Script.git) , [Grafana](https://github.com/akash-p-07/Grafana.git)  | Elastic Search, LogStash , Kiabana |
  
- Below are a few terms & technologies that I have been around and have an high level understanding of:
  * `Kafka` , `RabbitMQ` , `MicroServices` , `Big Data` , `MonoLithic Architecture`
  *  `Rest API's` , `DNS Linking` , `CPanel` , `ELK & EFK Stack` , `Blue/Green Deployments`
  *  `Network Security` , `Web Application Security` , `Secure Web Gateways` , `SSL/TLS` , `Bankend Security`
  *  `DevSecOps Architecture` , `IaaS Security with CASB`
